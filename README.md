# Machine-Learning
This project was for CSE 452 Machine Learning Lab.
Very basic ML codes for Apartment price prediction, Fakenews detection and Sentiment analysis.
Datasets are included.
You can just download the Python code and dataset and then run the program.
Datasets must be in the same directory as the Python code if you do not set directory by yourself.
